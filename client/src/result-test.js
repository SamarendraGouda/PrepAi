  overview:
    "This chapter of Calculus will focus on sequences and (infinite) series. It is important to understand some of the basics of sequences in order to properly deal with series. Series play an important role in the field of ordinary differential equations and large portions of the field of partial differential equations would not be possible without them. Topics covered in this chapter include sequences, convergence of sequences, infinite series, convergence/divergence of series, special series, integral test, and comparison test/limit comparison test.",
